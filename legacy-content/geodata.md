## Geodata

Working with geodata such as points, linestrings and polygons is beyond the scope of the indrz project.  If you are
looking for help to work and convert your geodata data for indrz directions api please contact us at GOMOGI
Communication is simple via email ([sales@gomogi.com](mailto:sales@gomogi.com)). 

### Georeferencing

All maps or plans must be georeferenced to work with indrz.  This means you need to give real world coordinates to
either your AutoCAD DWG files or images (png, jpeg, tiff, etc).

### Open Source software tools


1. Use [QuantumGIS] (http://www.qgis.org) and the Web map pluggin to view in google maps or satelite the building you want to georeference
2. Once you have found the building click File > export image,  this will export a georefence image from google maps
3. Open this georeferenced image as a background to place your AutoCAD or other digital data
